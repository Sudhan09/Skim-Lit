# SkimLit: NLP Milestone Project

This project is focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and aims to automatically classify scientific abstracts from PubMed based on their structure (e.g., Background, Objectives, Methods, Results, Conclusions).

## Project Overview

SkimLit (Skimming Literature) is a deep learning project that leverages **TensorFlow**, **TensorFlow Hub**, and **Spacy** for efficient scientific literature classification. The goal is to assist researchers in quickly skimming through large amounts of literature by summarizing the key parts of a scientific abstract.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the PubMed 200k RCT dataset, which contains randomized controlled trials.

## Installation

To get this project running, follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the repository
